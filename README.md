# matrix2


c++ matrix library
operators : *, +, - , << 
scalar muliplication

# Usage
see test.cpp and test2.cpp for examples of how to use the library

# implementation
dynamic allocation using an internal pointer
matrix product implemented using Strassen algorithm (subcubic computational complexity) for arbitrarily large matrices (row size > threshold)
